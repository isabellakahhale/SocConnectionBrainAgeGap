Updated on 10/09/2024: 
M2 images were acquired on a General Electric SIGNA 3T MRI scanner (Fairfield, CT) with a standard clinical whole-head transmit-receive quadrature head coil. A high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical image was acquired (T1-weighted inversion recovery fast gradient echo; 256 × 256 in-plane resolution; 240 mm FOV; 124 × 1.1 mm axial slices).

MR1 images were aqquired on General Electric MR750 3 T scanner (Waukesha, WI) using an 8-channel head coil. T1-weighted anatomical image  (TR = 8.2, TE = 3.2, flip angle = 12°, field of view = 256 mm, 256×256 matrix, 160 axial slices, inversion time = 450 ms). 

Standard niftii files were used in brain age computations.
